    """Checks that the GitHub Actions *linting* workflow is valid.

    This linting test checks that the GitHub Actions ``.github/workflows/linting.yml`` workflow
    correctly runs the ``nf-core lint``, ``markdownlint`` and ``yamllint`` commands.
    These three commands all check code syntax and code-style.
    Yes that's right - this is a lint test that checks that lint tests are running. Meta.

    This lint test checks this GitHub Actions workflow file for the following:

    * That the workflow is triggered on the  ``push`` and ``pull_request`` events, eg:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         on:
             push:
             pull_request:

    * That the workflow has a step that runs ``nf-core lint``, eg:


      .. code-block:: yaml

         jobs:
           nf-core:
             steps:
               - run: nf-core -l lint_log.txt lint ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE} --markdown lint_results.md

    * That the workflow has a step that runs ``markdownlint``, eg:


      .. code-block:: yaml

         jobs:
           Markdown:
             steps:
               - run: markdownlint ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE} -c ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/.github/markdownlint.yml

    * That the workflow has a step that runs ``yamllint``, eg:


      .. code-block:: yaml

         jobs:
           YAML:
             steps:
               - run: yamllint $(find ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE} -type f -name "*.yml")

    .. warning::  These are minimal examples of the commands and YAML structure and are not complete
               enough to be copied into the workflow file.
