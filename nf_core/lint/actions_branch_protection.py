def actions_branch_protection(self):
    """Checks that the GitHub Actions branch protection workflow is valid.

    A common error when making pull-requests to nf-core repositories is to open the
    PR against the default branch: ``master``. This branch should only have stable
    code from the latest release, so development PRs nearly always go to ``dev`` instead.
    We want ``master`` to be the default branch so that people pull this when running workflows.

    The only time that PRs against ``master`` are allows is when they come from a branch
    on the main nf-core repo called ``dev`` or a fork with a branch called ``patch``.

    The GitHub Actions ``.github/workflows/branch.yml`` workflow checks pull requests
    opened against ``master`` to ensure that they are coming from an allowed branch
    and throws an error if not. It also posts a comment to the PR explaining the failure
    and how to resolve it.

    Specifically, the lint test checks that:

    * The workflow is triggered for the ``pull_request_target`` event against ``master``:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         on:
           pull_request_target:
             branches:
             - master

      .. note:: The event ``pull_request_target`` is used and not ``pull_request`` so that
                it runs on the repo `recieving` the PR and has permissions to post a comment.
                The ``github.event`` object that we want is still confusingly called ``pull_request`` though.

    * The code that checks PRs to the protected nf-core repo ``master`` branch can only come from an nf-core ``dev`` branch or a fork ``patch`` branch:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         steps:
           # PRs to the nf-core repo master branch are only ok if coming from the nf-core repo `dev` or any `patch` branches
           - name: Check PRs
             if: github.repository == 'nf-core/<pipeline_name>'
             run: |
               { [[ ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} == nf-core/<pipeline_name> ]] && [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF = "dev" ]]; } || [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF == "patch" ]]

    .. tip:: For branch protection in repositories outside of `nf-core`, you can add an additional step to this workflow.
                 Keep the `nf-core` branch protection step, to ensure that the ``nf-core lint`` tests pass. It should just be ignored
                 if you're working outside of `nf-core`. Here's an example of how this code could look:

                 .. code-block:: yaml

                    steps:
                      # Usual nf-core branch check, looked for by the nf-core lint test
                      - name: Check PRs
                        if: github.repository == 'nf-core/<pipeline_name>'
                        run: |
                          { [[ ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} == nf-core/<pipeline_name> ]] && [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF = "dev" ]]; } || [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF == "patch" ]]

                      ##### Your custom code: Check PRs in your own repository
                      - name: Check PRs in another repository
                        if: github.repository == '<repo_name>/<pipeline_name>'
                        run: |
                          { [[ ${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}} == <repo_name>/<pipeline_name> ]] && [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF = "dev" ]]; } || [[ $GITHUB_HEAD_REF == "patch" ]]
